  -  $ For Building Netflix-GPT, we'll use create-react-app package to create our React-app
       create-react-app provides us ready-to-use reat-app template, it creates a organised
       strctured folder-strcture for us, it also setups testing for application
       So If we use CRA to create react app, we dont need to bundle, build or configure our app
       It does everthing on itself and saves our time.

       Behind the scene, CRA uses webpack bundler to bundle the app...
       Earlier, we used to parcel to bundle the app, Earlier we configured/itregated everthing  
       into our App like parcel for bundling, Tailwind for Stling css, jest and react-testing-lib
       for Testing
       We should do this if we want to customize our react-app according to our Requirements


  -  $ We have to configure Tailwind css acc to CRA


  -  $ We'll use Google FireBase for Backend

  
  -  $ We'll use ChatGPT API
